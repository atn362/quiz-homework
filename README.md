In this portion of the homework assignments, we were tasked with creating an interactive quiz program that allows for multiply choices, a timer countdown and the penalty for a wrong answer. I had quite a bit of fun creating this program.  Establishing what I found to be fun and difficult questions to challenge the user was of particular interest, along with personalizing each slide to fit the topic of question being asked.  For the purpose of running the functions I JavaScript, I primarily used JQuery and found it to be a much easier and user friendly means of programming.  I certainly cuts down on the length of code, making it easier to decipher and troubleshoot when a problem did occur.
